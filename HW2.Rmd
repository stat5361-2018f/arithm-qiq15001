## Exercise1 Approximation of distribution function of standard normal

### 1.1 Abstract

## Exercise2 
*.Machine$double.xmax* is the largest normalized floating-point number. Normally, it is 1.797693e+308.

*.Machine$double.xmin* is the smallest non-zero normalized floating-point number. Normally, it is 2.225074e-308.

*.Machine$double.eps* is the smallest positive floating-point number x such that $1 + x != 1$. Normally, it is 2.220446e-16.

*.Machine$double.neg.eps* is a small positive floating-point number x such that $1 - x != 1$. Normally, it is 1.110223e-16.
